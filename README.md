FlowActors
==========

A typed actor library.

* Typed channels (multiple in, multiple out)

* Message joins (between channels)

* Built in, configurable flow control.

* Safe, explicit wiring.

* Error channels for supervisors.

* Run on any executor including scala's ExecutionContext.

A user's guide will come.  
Here are some
